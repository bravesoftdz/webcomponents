<p>Function <b>vkthread.runAll()</b> let you to  create multiple threads and execute task in these threads independently. In computer science it is known as "parallel computing". This technology significantly gain performance on multi-core CPU computers. </p>
 <p>
This page demonstrates an advantage of multi-threading on multi-core CPU. The first example runs foo() function in a single thread. The second one divides this function in 2 tasks and runs a separate thread for each of them. At OS kernel level these threads are executed in 2 CPU cores, which makes this application about 60%-70% faster. <br/>
It doesn't make sense to create too many threads, as number of CPU cores is limited. The best case is: number of cpu cores is equal to number of threads.

<pre><code data-language="javascript">function foo(start,end){
	var sum = 0,
		dummy = 'a,b,c,d,e',
	    ix;

	for(ix=start; ix&lt;end; ix++){
		dummy.split(',').join('-'); // do something to slowdown the process
		sum = sum+ix;
	}
	return sum;
}
</code></pre>

<input type="button" value="Run in Page" onclick="run_dummySum_time()" />
	<span class="span_demo_result" id="demo_result"></span>
	<input value="clear" type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('demo_result').innerHTML =''"/>
<pre><code data-language="javascript">vkthread.run(foo, [0, 8e6]).then(
	function (data) {
		var bar = data;
		console.log(bar);
	})
</code></pre>

	<input type="button" value="Run in Thread" onclick="runAll_dummySum_time()" />

	<span class="span_demo_result"  id="demo_result_thread"></span>
	<input value="clear"  type="button"  onclick="document.getElementById('demo_result_thread').innerHTML =''"/>

<pre><code data-language="javascript">vkthread.runAll([ [foo, [0, 4e6]],
		  [foo, [4e6, 8e6]]]).then(
	function (data) {
		var bar = data[0]+data[1];
		console.log(bar);
	})
</code></pre>
 <p>
However, we can't  guarantee, that OS runs these threads on different cores
as it depends on many things, which we are not able to control with javascript.
 But there is a very good chance that threads, opened with runAll(), will be executed in parallel.
